# MineSweeperConsole
Mine Sweeper Game on Console (Java)

This is a simple version of minesweeper game that can be played on console.
Ver 1.0:
In the game you can create your game board with desired size. Also, the cells on the board show different numbers if they are not mines.
-2: there is no mine around the related cell.
-1: mine
1 to 8: the #number of mines around the related cell.

If you find a mine, game is over. Otherwise, you will get points each time you pass mines. When you find each cell  without mine, you win the game.

Notes:
The coding process of version 1.0 was generally based on the "Mini Mayın Tarlası Oyunu" video of Kodlama Vakti, YouTube.
Here, the mine check of the related cell includes all neighbour cells.
